- offer help to others whenever you can
- show respect for the experiences and viewpoints of others
- give and accept constructive feedback from others with grace
- use welcoming and helpful language with other members
- give new or less experienced members the benefit of the doubt. There are no “stupid questions”!
- participate in an authentic way that enriches the entire community

# Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and to all members of the community including FieldKit staff. It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, e.g. acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.


# Application and Enforcement of the Code of Conduct
The FieldKit team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The FieldKit team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject any contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. We will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

We may employ technical tools to identify and flag postings that contain objectionable material. If you see a contribution that you think is objectionable, please flag it and the staff will investigate. All complaints will be reviewed and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The FieldKit team will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

We at FieldKit maintain the right and **responsibility** to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
